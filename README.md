# Console Transcription App
This is a proof-of-concept C# / .NET application that captures system audio using the NAudio library and streams in real-time to Azure Cognitive Services for immediate speech-to-text transcription in a console.

Requires the API key to an Azure Speech Services instance.

## Planned features

- Migrate from a console window to an interactive UI
- Add cross-platform support (Linux and Android)
