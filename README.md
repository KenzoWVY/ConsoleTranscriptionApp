# Speech Transcription App
This is a proof-of-concept C# / .NET application that captures system audio using the NAudio library and streams in real-time to Azure Cognitive Services for immediate speech-to-text transcription using a MAUI interface.

Requires the API key to an Azure Speech Services instance.

Due to audio driver limitations, this program can only run on Windows.
